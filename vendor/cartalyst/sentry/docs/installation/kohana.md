## Installing in Kohana 3.3.x (with Composer)

Using Sentry with Kohhana is easy if you have composer enabled on your project.

Open `composer.json` (put it in you Kohana's project root) and add these lines:

	{
		"require": {
			"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*",
			"ircmaxell/password-compat": "1.0.*",
			"happydemon/txt": "1.0.1"
		},
		"minimum-stability": "dev"
	}

Only the Kohana port of Sentry needs the `happydemon/txt` package since it uses a helper that does not come bundled with Kohana by default.

Next navigate to your `kohana`'s project folder in the terminal and run `composer update`.

If you haven't activated composer's autoloader already, you should put the following in `application/bootstrap.php` below `spl_autoload_register(array('Kohana', 'auto_load'));`:

	// Enable composer based autoloading
	require DOCROOT.'vendor/autoload.php';

Great! You now have composer working with Kohana.

Just a few more steps, right at the bottom of that same file, `application/bootstrap.php`, put the following:

	class_alias('Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\Kohana\Sentry', 'Sentry');

This will mean you can use the Kohana Sentry facade as the class `Sentry`. 

Please import `schema/mysql.sql` into your database before going further.

Let's get the models that come bundled with Sentry working with Kohana's `ORM`. There are 2 ways of doing this, 
you can either create the models in your `application/classes/Model` and make them extend Sentry's models
or alias the classes if you're not going to be adding nay extra methods to those classes.

For the sake of keeping this guide short we'll just alias the models in `application/bootstrap.php`:

    class_alias('\Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\Kohana\Group', 'Model_Group');
    class_alias('\Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\Kohana\User', 'Model_User');
    class_alias('\Cartalyst\Sentry\Throttling\Kohana\Throttle', 'Model_Throttle');

Lastly you can add a `Sentry` config file to optionally change the default configuration. You would have to create a config file called `application/config/sentry.php` and paste in this piece of code:

    <?php defined('SYSPATH' OR die('No direct access allowed.'));
    /**
     * Sentry config file
     */
    return array(
    	/**
    	 * Sentry specific setup
    	 */
    	'session_driver' => 'native', //native or database @see Kohana_Session::instance()
    	'session_key' => 'cartalyst_sentry',
    	'cookie_key' => 'cartalyst_sentry',
    	'hasher' => 'Bcrypt' //Bcrypt, Native or Sha256
    );

VoilÃ ! Sentry automatically works with your current database configuration, there is no further setup required.

> **Note**: Sentry will always run off the default database connection, so ensure this is working. We may look at adding support for alternate connections in the future however it is not implemented at this stage. Pull requests are welcome.
